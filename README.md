# pandas-challenge-1
This project focused on data analysis using Python's Pandas library. We worked with a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company to address real-world business questions. The primary goals included identifying top customers, analyzing popular product categories, and calculating profits. The challenge involved importing, exploring, transforming, and summarizing data to extract meaningful insights.

Objectives
Understand DataFrames: Importing and exporting CSV files, utilizing the head and tail functions, creating DataFrames from lists or dictionaries, renaming columns, sorting values, and viewing summary statistics using describe.
Data Exploration: Use foundational Python concepts to explore data with Pandas, including mean, sum, nunique, value_counts, and more.
Data Transformation: Create new columns, use apply to transform a column, fill or drop missing values, replace text, and format text.
Answer Abstract Questions: Use Pandas to answer complex business questions.
Data Exploration
Column Names: Viewed column names using df.columns.
Basic Statistics: Gathered statistics using the describe function.
Category Analysis: Identified the top three item categories and the most popular subcategory within the top category.
Top Clients: Identified the top five clients by the number of entries and stored their IDs in a list.
Total Units Ordered: Calculated the total units ordered by the client with the most entries.
Data Transformation
Subtotal Calculation: Created a column to calculate the subtotal for each line using unit_price and qty.
Shipping Price: Calculated shipping price based on total weight with different rates for orders over and under 50 pounds.
Total Price: Created a column for the total price using subtotal, shipping price, and a sales tax of 9.25%.
Line Cost: Calculated the cost of each line using unit_cost, qty, and shipping price.
Line Profit: Calculated profit for each line using line cost and line price.
Confirming Work
Confirmed the total prices for three specific orders against provided email receipts:

#Order ID 2742071: $152,811.89
#Order ID 2173913: $162,388.71
#Order ID 6128929: $923,441.25

Summarizing and Analyzing
Top Clients by Spending: Calculated the total spending of the top five clients.
Summary DataFrame: Created a summary DataFrame with total units purchased, total shipping price, total revenue, and total profit for the top five clients.
Formatting Data: Converted financial values to millions of dollars and renamed columns for presentation.
Sorted Data: Sorted the DataFrame by total profit in descending order.
Improvements
Formatted Financial Data: Converted financial values to millions of dollars to meet formatting requirements.
Provided Summary: Included a brief summary of findings to enhance the final presentation.
Findings
The top five clients contributed significantly to the total revenue and profit. This analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior and spending patterns, which can inform business strategies and decision-making processes.

Overall, the project demonstrated the practical application of data exploration, transformation, and analysis techniques using Pandas, highlighting the importance of clean, well-structured data in deriving actionable business insights.
